# Salve Test App

You will need to run two terminals to get this project to work. One for the back-end and one for the frontend.

In the the first terminal, to start up the api back-end; open up the project folder and run the following:

```
"cd backend/api"
"npm run install"
"npm run start"
```

This will install the dependencies required for the back-end and then proceed to run it on localhost:4000.

In the second terminal, to start up the frontend; from the project folder, run the following:

```
"cd frontend"
"npm run install"
"npm run start"
```

This will install the dependencies required for the frontend and then proceed to run it.

Running this should automatically open a browser tab at localhost:3000, which should then show the home page which in this case is the patient list.
